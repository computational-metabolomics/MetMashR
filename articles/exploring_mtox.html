<p>To explore the biological space covered by the metabolites in

biological pathways that the metabolites are part of.</p>
<p>We use the <a href="https://pathbank.org/" class="external-link">PathBank</a> for this
purpose. A <code>struct_database</code> object for PathBank is already
included in <code>MetMashR</code>.</p>

<p><code>MetMashR</code> provides the
<code>PathBank_metabolite_databse</code> object to import the PathBank
database. You can choose to import:</p>
<ul>
<li>The “primary” database. This is a smaller version of the database
restricted to primary pathways.</li>
<li>The “complete” database, which includes all pathways in the
database.</li>
</ul>
<p>The “complete” database is a &gt;50mb download, and unzipped is
&gt;1Gb. Unzipping and caching of the database is handled by
[BiocFileCache].</p>
<p>For the vignette we restrict to the “primary” PathBank database to
keep file sizes and downloads to a minimum.</p>
<p>We can use the database in two ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>convert it to a source and “mash” it with other sources</li>
<li>use it as a lookup table to add information to an existing
source.</li>
</ol>
<p>To explore the biological space covered by MetMashR we will do
both.</p>

<p>We can see that MTox700+ largely focuses on metabolites related to
Disease metabolism and general metabolism, which is concomitant with the
database being curated to contain metabolites relevant to toxicology in
humans.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="combining-records">Combining records<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#combining-records"></a>
</h3>
<p>Metabolites can appear in multiple pathways. The PathBank database
therefore contains multiple records for the same metabolite, and the
relationship between MTox700+ and PathBank is one-to-many.</p>
<p>After obtaining pathway information from PathBank the new table has
many more rows than the original MTox700+ database, as each MTox700+
record has been replicated for each match in the PathBank database.</p>
<p>e.g. after importing MTox700+ the number of records was:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co"># Number in MTox700+</span></span>

<span><span class="co">#&gt; [1] 1222</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>After combing with PathBank the number of records is:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co"># Number after PathBank lookup</span></span>

<p>We have used the <code>.unique</code> helper function so that records
for each inchikey are combined into a single record by only retaining
unique values in each field (column). If there are multiple unique
values for a field then they are combined into a single string using the
” || ” separator.</p>
<p>We can now extract the pathways associated with a particular
metabolite. For example Glycolic acid:</p>
