<p>To explore the biological space covered by the metabolites in
MTox700+ we need mash the database with additional information about the
biological pathways that the metabolites are part of.</p>
<p>We use the <a href="https://pathbank.org/" class="external-link">PathBank</a> for this
purpose. A <code>struct_database</code> object for PathBank is already
included in <code>MetMashR</code>.</p>

</h3>
<p><code>MetMashR</code> provides the
<code>PathBank_metabolite_databse</code> object to import the PathBank
database. You can choose to import:</p>
<ul>
<li>The “primary” database. This is a smaller version of the database
restricted to primary pathways.</li>
<li>The “complete” database, which includes all pathways in the
database.</li>
</ul>
<p>The “complete” database is a &gt;50mb download, and unzipped is
&gt;1Gb. Unzipping and caching of the database is handled by
[BiocFileCache].</p>
<p>For the vignette we restrict to the “primary” PathBank database to
keep file sizes and downloads to a minimum.</p>
<p>We can use the database in two ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>convert it to a source and “mash” it with other sources</li>
<li>use it as a lookup table to add information to an existing
source.</li>
</ol>
<p>To explore the biological space covered by MetMashR we will do
both.</p>

MTox700+ is a much smaller database due to it being a curated list of
metabolites with toxicologial relevance, and PathBank is more

<p>Metabolites can appear in multiple pathways. The PathBank database
therefore contains multiple records for the same metabolite, and the
relationship between MTox700+ and PathBank is one-to-many.</p>
<p>After obtaining pathway information from PathBank the new table has
many more rows than the original MTox700+ database, as each MTox700+

<p>Sometimes it is useful to collapse this information into a single

<p>We have used the <code>.unique</code> helper function so that records
for each inchikey are combined into a single record by only retaining
unique values in each field (column). If there are multiple unique
values for a field then they are combined into a single string using the
” || ” separator.</p>
<p>We can now extract the pathways associated with a particular
metabolite. For example Glycolic acid:</p>
